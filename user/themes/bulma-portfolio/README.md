## Usage

Most components have been built using Blueprints and thus simplifying the end-user experience and magically appear in the front-end :)

Carousels  => end user can select images, add text, buttons, etc ... 

Features  => end user can add as many as needed, select Font-Awesome icons, add text, links, etc ...

Products / Portfolio items => end user ads images, descriptions, categories, etc ...

Forms => most Bulma fields have been ported to the theme, but more are welcomed
